# Overview

We are currently recruiting sponsors for the 2019 Waterhackweek. 
# Roles and sponsorship tiers

If you are intersted in sponsoring a Hackweek event (e.g. student-industry mixer, welcome and farewell receptions) please contact Rachel Murray at rlmurray@uw.edu. Sponsors will benefit from advertising their company, 
            networking with data scientists, discovering new technology and research and collaborating on projects. Other opportunities include sponsoring
            a need-based student to support diversity and education evaluation for hackweek best practices.
            

What does this mean from the perspective of a sponsor? We invite you to design your sponsorship goals with the below sponsorship tier framework in mind:

As a hackweek sponsor for this event, your number one responsibility is also to adhere to the hackweek [code of conduct](https://waterhackweek.github.io/wiki/code_of_conduct.html) designed by the Seattle data science community. Your visibility throughout the event provides you with a unique opportunity to demonstrate professional, respectful behaviors that other participants can emulate throughout the week. 

# What can sponsors expect to gain from this experience?

Hackweeks have traditionally been very dynamic events at which knowledge is exchanged in multiple directions across different levels of career position and backgrounds. We hope you will have an opportunity to learn a lot of new things by engaging in this experience. Past tutorial leads have used these events to gain teaching experience and as a way to round out their teaching profile. Like other participants you can also expect to build new contacts in the community, recruit students and generate new project ideas.
