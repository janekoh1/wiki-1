summary: Overview of the Geohackweek

### What is a hackweek? 
The hackweek model has emerged within the data science community as a powerful tool for fostering exchange of ideas in research and computation by providing training in modern data analysis workflows. In contrast to conventional academic conferences or workshops, hackweeks are intensive and interactive, facilitated by three core components: tutorials on state-of-the-art methodology, peer-learning, and on-site project work in a collaborative environment. This setup is particularly powerful for sciences that require not only domain-specific knowledge, but also effective computational workflows to foster rapid exchange of ideas and make discovery, as has been shown by the success of the previous Astro-, Neuro-, and Oceanhackweeks. This is an excellent match with the nature of geographic research where data are large and complex and the community is diverse and collaborative.

### Quick Info

### Flights and commuting 
- Participants are responsible for covering all travel and lodging costs. If you are a funded participant who has received a grant letter of support, please review the last section of this page for Participants with Travel Grants.  
- Seattle-Tacoma International Airport offers a range of connections to the University of Washington Campus.
- The [Link light rail](https://www.soundtransit.org/Schedules/Link-light-rail) is an easy, great way to get to the UW from the airport. It arrives at the airport every 5-15 minutes and stops at UW campus (last stop) just a 15-minute walk from the event venue. From the arrivals hall at Sea-Tac Airport, follow the signs for Link Light Rail; the station is a short walk from the terminal on the far side of the parking garage. Tickets must be purchased at the station before boarding. The cost is $3.25 and can be paid in cash or with a credit/debit card. Take the train to the last stop (UW). [Here are directions](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/UW+%2F+Husky+Stadium+Link+Station,+Montlake+Boulevard+Northeast,+Seattle,+WA/Lander+Hall,+Northeast+Campus+Parkway,+Seattle,+WA/@47.6528701,-122.3174734,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x549014eca005d559:0x2a5b4b6f98dddc9c!2m2!1d-122.3037817!2d47.6498128!1m5!1m1!1s0x549014f3ba755af3:0x942b03c21f9cc45e!2m2!1d-122.3148976!2d47.655826!3e2) for walking from the UW link stop to Lander Hall where you will check in if you are staying in a dorm at Alder Hall.
- Taxicabs and uber/lyft are also available from the airport. Note that for uber/lyft you will meet the car in the 3rd floor parking lot for pick up.

### Lodging 
- All participants have the option of being randomly paired with another participant of the same sex in a double dorm for $56.50 per night at Alder Hall. They can also stay in a single dorm at Alder Hall for $96 per night. If you prefer either of these options, you must let us know by emailing geohack@uw.edu by August 16 to be added to the list. Those who sign up will receive a link to pay online for their stay. 
- UW has some [homestay programs](https://www.ielp.uw.edu/housing/homestays/) which may be worth looking into as well. However, there may be some additional commuting you will have to do depending on where your homestay location is if you decide to go with this option.
- If you prefer to stay at a hotel, the University of Washington maintains a list of hotels near campus on its [website](http://fyp.washington.edu/getting-started-at-the-university-of-washington/transportation-options/hotel-accommodations/).

### Particpants with Travel Grants

- Your grant can be used to cover any travel costs such as airfare and commuting expenses. Lodging and meals can only be reimbursed up to the [GSA Seattle per diem rate](https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates/per-diem-rates-lookup/?action=perdiems_report&state=WA&fiscal_year=2019&zip=&city=). Please note that business or first class airfare cannot be reimbursed for any reason. 
- All flights must adhere to outlined guidelines as for federal funds [see “Travel” in article 10](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/gc1/jan17.pdf) and the [Fly America Act](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/travel-management-policy/fly-america-act). International travelers must additionally provide a traveler’s I-94 form which are completed upon entry into the US. If you have any questions about travel policies, please email travel@uw.edu
- Expenses of Individual flights must be itemized on documented receipts, along with commuting expenses such as bus tickets, shuttle receipts, etc. Please be especially aware of this when using travel expense aggregating websites such as expedia.com, as not all of these sorts of websites clearly itemize individual travel expenses.
- After making sure that all the above requirements are met, please go ahead and book your flights and hold onto all documentation for claiming your reimbursement after the event. All funded travelers will be put in contact with the travel coordinator to send their documentation to via email for reimbursement after the event has concluded.
